# simpleapi

This codebase is mostly used for testing. Basically, I took a merchant feed from ShareASale, and stuffed it into a database, then used the SLIM PHP framework to pull out the information. Since the data in the API is input by the merchants, there's not always solid data. For instance, the ezcosplay datafeed has one merchantcategory.  

It's not private at all, and infact contains affilate links.

Don't frget the inc/connect.inc file. Use the sample as a sample.
